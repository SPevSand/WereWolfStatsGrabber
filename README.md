# WereWolfStatsGrabber
Uses tgwerewolf.com site to display last kills. Who and by who.

## How to setup?
1. $pip install -r requirements.txt
2. In the same directory put players.txt file with short names and IDs.  
  Syntax:
  
  name1:123  
  name2:456  
  
## Where do I get IDs of players?  
You can get it with @userinfobot

## Why it doesn't always shows recent kills?  
The script shows only the lastest changes on https://www.tgwerewolf.com/Stats/Player/*userid* site, which shows only the top kills. It takes time for the script to respond to new players.
